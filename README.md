# Sublime Text - Load Project

Plugin that looks up the file tree and loads the first *.sublime-project file that it comes across.

Very useful if you've opened a directory rather than loading the project. Simply select "Load Project: Current Folder" from the Command Pallette

## Installation
Clone this project into the Sublime Text *Packages* directory. (Correct directory can be found in Sublime Text by selected *Preferences > Browse Packages...*)
